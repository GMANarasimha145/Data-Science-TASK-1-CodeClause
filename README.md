The Repository constitutes the implementation of FAKE NEWS DETECTION using Machine Learning models, The implementation will takes text as input from the user and then classified whether it is FAKE NEWS OR TRUE, if the news is TRUE then user can summarize and translate the Text, So, user can be aware fake news and true news.
# Fake News Detection and Translation (Data Science Internship Project)

Welcome to the Fake News Detection and Translation project! This repository showcases a data science project that aims to detect fake news articles and, if the news is genuine, provides a summary and translation.

## Overview

In today's digital age, distinguishing between fake and real news is more critical than ever. This project leverages Python and data science techniques to classify news articles as either fake or true. Here's a brief overview of what the project accomplishes:

- **Fake News Detection:** The project uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to classify news articles as fake or true.

- **Summarization:** If a user inputs a true news article, the system can automatically summarize the content, making it easier for users to grasp the key points quickly.

- **Translation:** Additionally, if the news is genuine, the system translates it into multiple languages, enhancing accessibility for a global audience.

## Key Libraries Used

- **SpaCy and NLTK:** These libraries are employed for text preprocessing and NLP tasks.

- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn):** Sklearn is used to build robust classification models for fake news detection.

- **Googletrans:** This library enables seamless translation capabilities, breaking down language barriers.
